# Japanese-landscape
I like to design discord themes which i been doing for a while and only recently thought about actually uploading them to better discord and seeing if people would like what i produced, my favourite project so far is the "Japanese landscape" which involves nice bright colours mostly containing pink.
You CANNOT republish this project IF it looks TOO similar to the orginal HOWEVER if you edit it to the point where it is NOT similar to the original then its OK!
